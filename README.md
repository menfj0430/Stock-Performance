A report on each language has also been added to see the results that were obtained by me. the report also describes the steps and explains the program

I have only added the small data set as the huge dataset is just not possible to upload here even in the zip format!

Steps to run :
Download the zip folder in a SLURM environmnet
Step2 
unzip the small data set
Step 3 :
Edit the SLURM script and set the data base location as well as the nodes, the email address

Step 4 : run it on small data set
